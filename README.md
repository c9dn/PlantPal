# PlantPal

## Inspiration

Neighborhoods and communities around the world face a significant issue: a lack of bonding. PlantPal addresses this problem with an eco-friendly twist. By fostering communal activities centered around nature and environmental preservation, PlantPal aims to strengthen community bonds while also promoting a greener environment.

## What it does

PlantPal offers a gamified system where community members can earn points by discovering and photographing new plants. The app uses AI to verify the presence of new plants through satellite imagery and Google Street View. Communities accumulate points through collective activities, fostering unity and environmental consciousness.

## How we built it

PlantPal utilizes a robust tech stack with a Django and a SQL backend. The frontend, created using HTML and Cordova, is transformed into a mobile app. The mapping feature employs leaflet to accurately get important coordinates. AI, powered by a customized cv2 ensures the integrity of plants. The user interface and experience were designed in Figma and developed using Franken UI.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced several challenges during development, including efficiently storing and processing user-picked coordinates for the mapping feature. Implementing the user location  algorithm for essential features. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of plant verification through AI requires lots of effort.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We used many new frameworks such as Cordova,  and Franken UI in the frontend. In the backend, we used Django which we were new at.

## What we learned

Through the development of PlantPal, we learned the importance of efficient data management and the challenges of integrating advanced AI for real-world applications. We also gained insights into designing engaging and intuitive user interfaces. .

## What's next for PlantPal

The next steps for PlantPal include exploring partnerships with companies to offer community prizes for top-performing communities. We plan to develop advanced algorithms for enhanced integrity detection, ensuring the app's positive environmental impact. Additionally, we aim to explore monetization options, such as operating as a nonprofit funded by donations or offering a subscription service with advanced features like point boosters, while maintaining our primary focus on social good.
